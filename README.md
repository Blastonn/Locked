# 🔐 Locked – The Social Network Based on Discovery

**Created by Felipe Ribeiro Paulo**  

---

## 🧠 Concept

**Locked** is a social network that flips the current model of digital interaction.  
Instead of open profiles, instant likes, and superficial browsing, here you only get to know someone through **effort, curiosity, and discovery**.

Every profile is a kind of “lock” that only opens when the visitor shows real interest in understanding who’s behind the surface.

---

## 🔍 How It Works

- Each profile starts by showing **only one piece of content** — a photo, sentence, or post chosen by the user.
- All other content is **locked behind layers**.
- To unlock it, visitors must **solve challenges created by the profile owner.**

These challenges can include:
- Personal questions
- Riddles or puzzles
- Subjective interpretations
- Visual or sound clues
- Anything the user decides to create as a filter

---

## 🔒 Purposeful Privacy

On Locked, privacy is **intentional and interactive**.  
The user decides:
- What to show
- When to show it
- Who can see it

It’s not about hiding.  
It’s about saying:

> *“If you truly want to know me, prove it. I’m worth the effort.”*

---

## 🎯 Mission

Locked aims to be an alternative to the fast-paced, shallow nature of current social networks.  
A place where:
- Each person deserves to be **discovered, not consumed**
- Every connection requires **focus, effort, and intention**
- Each profile is a **journey**, not a feed

## 📐 Current Status

This project is in its **idea and planning phase**.  
It is being developed as a **personal and learning project** by its creator, Felipe Ribeiro — a programming student building both skills and vision through this concept.

All design, functional, and technical decisions will be documented in this repository.
